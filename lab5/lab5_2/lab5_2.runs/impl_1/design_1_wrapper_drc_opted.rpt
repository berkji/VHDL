CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of design_1_i/mig_7series_0/u_design_1_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_IN/memory_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_IN/memory_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_IN/raddr[5]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_IN_ADDR_GEN/addr_s_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1840#20 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_OUT/memory_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_OUT/memory_reg/ENARDEN (net: design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_OUT/wen) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/myip2_0/U0/myip2_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/U_WRAPPER/U_USER_APP/U_MEM_OUT_ADDR_GEN/FSM_sequential_state_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
